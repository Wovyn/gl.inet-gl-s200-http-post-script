# GL.iNet Thread Development Board Enclosure
An enclosure for GL.iNet Thread Development Boards in the A0+A1 configuration.

I wanted to create an enclosure for the Thread Development Baords.  In my installations, I tend to hang them above wall outlets so that I can plug in a wall-wart USB power supply, and then use a 5-6 foot USB cable to power them.

This is a first version of the enclosure, and currently I hold the top cover on using a twist-tie, or small clear rubber bands.  I'm working to put proper tabs on the top cover to hold it in place.

## TODO

- Add tabs to top cover to keep in in place
- Possibly add slot to allow power LED to be seen easier
-
